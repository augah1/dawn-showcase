This is a customized version of Shopify's Dawn theme that showcases some features added by Adanna Ugah. It has been built with optimization and flexibility in mind, and aligned with current web standards.

## Customizations

* **Free Shipping Bar:** A dynamic free shipping bar has been added to the top of the page. As customers add items to their cart or adjust quantities, the bar updates in real-time to show how much more they need to spend to qualify for free shipping; or once they’ve reached the threshold. The calculation is designed to reflect the user’s local currency for a seamless shopping experience; and the threshold is set within a custom-added theme setting.
* **Consent Checkbox:** A consent checkbox has been added to the site’s footer, requiring customers to agree before subscribing to the store’s newsletter. Submissions are blocked until consent is given, and the consent data is stored in the Shopify admin for record-keeping.
